"""Lighting scheduler — schedule transitions for future execution.

Jobs are persisted to ~/.config/heylux/schedule.json so they survive
daemon restarts. The daemon runs a background loop that checks for due
jobs every 10 seconds.

The Hue bridge natively supports transition times up to ~109 minutes
(65535 deciseconds). At the scheduled start time, we set the initial
state instantly, then send the end state with a long transitiontime —
the bridge handles the gradual ramp.
